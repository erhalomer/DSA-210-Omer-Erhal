# DSA 210 Project Proposal  
 Forecasting Future Sales Using Company Transaction Data  

Name: Ömer erhal
ID: 31032

This project focuses on forecasting future sales using the company’s internal transaction records, which include both sales and purchase data 
The main goal is to analyze how historical trends, customer behavior, and operational factors such as stock intake and pricing influence future sales volumes.  
 the project seeks to answer:  
 “Can we predict future sales performance based on historical purchase and sales behaviors?”

The findings will support business planning, optimize inventory levels, and help the company better anticipate demand patterns in the iron and steel industry.

2- Data Description  

The dataset consists of sales and purchase records obtained from the company’s internal systems.  
Because the data contains commercially sensitive information, the raw dataset cannot be shared publicly.  
Below are mock sample rows (non-real) for demonstration of the Data:

| Date | Customer | Product_Type | Quantity | Price |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| 2024-06-15 | Customer_A | THICK | 1200 | 14500 |
| 2024-06-16 | Customer_B | THIN | 800 | 14850 |

| Date | Supplier | Product_Type | Quantity | Price |
|------|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| 2024-06-14 | Supplier_X | KÜTÜK | 1500 | 9200 |
| 2024-06-17 | Supplier_Y | KÜTÜK | 2000 | 9400 |

---

3- Data Cleaning and Preparation and Graphs

Data preprocessing will include the following steps:

- Convert all date fields to datetime format  
- Standardize numeric columns (fix “.” / “,” inconsistencies)  
- Handle missing values: 
  - Price: Forward-fill (use previous valid value)  
  - Purchase quantity: Assume `0` for non-purchase days  
- Normalize text fields (uppercase, stripped whitespace)

The boxplot of sales quantities indicates that the majority of transactions are concentrated below approximately 400–500 Tons, with the median located close to this lower range. In contrast, several observations exceed 1,000 units, and a small number of extreme values reach levels above 4,000 units. This substantial gap between typical sales volumes and maximum observed values demonstrates a strongly right-skewed distribution. Such a distribution is consistent with the iron and steel industry, where frequent low-volume sales coexist with occasional high-volume bulk orders, and therefore does not indicate a structural problem in the dataset.

The boxplot of sales prices shows that the majority of transactions are concentrated within a narrow range of approximately 25,000 to 30,000 TRY, with the median located inside this interval. This indicates a relatively stable pricing structure for most sales. However, a small number of extreme outliers are observed, including one transaction exceeding 240,000 TRY and another close to zero. These values likely correspond to exceptional transactions or special pricing cases and do not represent the typical sales price level. Overall, the distribution is right-skewed and consistent with pricing behavior in the iron and steel industry.

The scatter plot of sales price versus sales quantity shows that most transactions are concentrated within a narrow price range of approximately 22,000 to 32,000 TRY across a wide range of quantities, extending up to around 1,500 Tons. No clear upward or downward trend is observed, and the data points form a largely horizontal cloud. Although a small number of extreme outliers are present, these observations are rare and do not affect the overall pattern. This visual evidence supports the statistical finding of a very weak and insignificant relationship between sales price and sales quantity.

4- Research Questions  

1. Do past sales quantities contain predictive information about future sales?  
2. Do changes in sales price significantly affect sales volume?  
3. Does the purchase (stock intake) quantity affect sales performance after a lag period?

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key findings from EDA:

- Daily sales are irregular but show a weak monthly cycle  
- İNCE product type dominates total sales  
- TRY-based sale prices steadily increase over time  
- TRY prices closely follow USD/TRY movements  
- No visible relationship between price and sales quantity  
- No visible relationship between purchases and sales  
- Weak monthly seasonality exists (supports lag-30 hypothesis)

These observations guided the hypothesis tests below.

5. Hypothesis Testing

All hypotheses were evaluated using linear regression, Pearson correlation, and p-value significance testing.

---

Hypothesis 1: Past Sales → Future Sales

Null Hypothesis (H01): Past sales quantities have no relationship with future sales.  
Alternative Hypothesis (H11): Past sales quantities significantly affect future sales.

Test Results:

| Lag | Correlation | R2 | p-value | Interpretation |
|-----|-------------|----|---------|----------------|
| 7-day lag  | -0.1192 | 0.0142 | 0.0609 | Not significant |
| 21-day lag | -0.0049 | 0.0000 | 0.9403 | No relationship |
| 30-day lag | 0.1374  | 0.0189 | 0.0395 | Significant |

Conclusion:  
Only the 30-day lag is significant.  
Past monthly sales help predict future sales.

7. Machine Learning Methods and Results

This section presents the machine learning methods applied to the dataset in order to evaluate the predictive performance of key variables and to complement the statistical hypothesis testing results.

 Supervised Learning: Sales Forecasting
Problem Definition

The objective of the supervised learning task is to forecast future daily sales quantities using historical transaction data.
The target variable is daily sales quantity, while input features include:

Lagged sales quantities (1-day, 7-day, 14-day, 30-day lags)

Rolling averages of sales quantities and prices (7-day, 30-day)

Daily average sales price

Daily purchase quantity

Calendar features (day of week, day of month, month)

To avoid data leakage, TimeSeriesSplit (5-fold) cross-validation was used instead of random train–test splits.

Baseline Models

Before applying machine learning models, simple baseline forecasts were evaluated:

Baseline	MAE	RMSE
Lag-1 (Yesterday = Today)	1032.12	1685.71
Lag-30 (30 Days Ago = Today)	1050.11	1635.61

These baselines provide reference error levels without any learning process.

ML Model Performance (Horizon = 1 Day)
Model	MAE	RMSE
Gradient Boosting Regressor	846.20	1280.73
Random Forest Regressor	892.95	1262.35
Linear Regression	1554.82	2099.64

Observation:
Both ensemble-based models significantly outperform the baseline approaches. Gradient Boosting achieves the lowest MAE, indicating superior short-term forecasting performance.

ML Model Performance (Horizon = 30 Days)
Model	MAE	RMSE
Random Forest Regressor	739.17	1024.80
Gradient Boosting Regressor	767.24	1149.53
Lag-30 Baseline	976.12	1636.97
Linear Regression	2648.29	3398.05

Observation:
For longer-term forecasting, Random Forest provides the best performance, improving MAE by approximately 24% compared to the Lag-30 baseline.

🔹 Unsupervised Learning: Customer Segmentation

To explore purchasing behavior patterns, K-Means clustering (k = 4) was applied to customer-level features:

Total purchased quantity

Average sales price

Number of transactions

Number of active transaction days

Cluster Summary
Cluster	Customers	Avg Total Qty	Avg Price (TRY)	Avg Transactions	Avg Active Days
0	54	276.51	27757.58	3.56	2.85
1	6	5875.75	26467.72	81.17	62.17
2	65	456.80	25039.80	4.20	3.57
3	20	6435.52	26081.48	24.95	22.95

Interpretation:
The clustering results reveal distinct customer segments, ranging from small-volume occasional buyers to high-volume and highly frequent customers. This segmentation provides additional insight into demand structure and customer behavior.
